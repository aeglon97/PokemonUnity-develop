# PokemonUnity-develop
Creation of a language-immersion game using the Pokemon Unity fan engine.

## Motivation
A friend and I wanted to see how digital language immersion would help retain new vocabulary words for players with no previous experience of that language. We theorized that digital language immersion should be equally or more effective than real-world language immersion. 

After developing our Pokemon Unity Spanish-language immersion game, we cycled through 3 iterations of user-group testing, all with people of various RPG experience. The point was to randomize our sampling as much as possible.

Throughout gameplay, users would stumble across new Spanish words through context & interaction with the environment. These words would be repeated by context throughout gameplay, and users were tested on their retention at the end of each playthrough.

Reports of user-testing groups are given in the `report.pdf` file.

## How to play
1. Download Unity 5.x
2. After launching, select 'Open Project'
3. Select 'PokemonUnity-develop'
4. Press the 'Play' button at the top of the screen.

## Known Bugs
1. Before Ruta 2, the Professor Event collision trigger resets after entering and exiting any building. To sidestep this, step left or right when passing by again.
2. Dimmed lighting effects after exiting building into the Overworld.
