# How to create a folder of frames

I apologise that this process isn't completely automated.
Hopefully in future all Pokémon sprites will be processed and available.
Check the subreddit and other documentation for details.

## How to use

### open in GIMP

* increase canvas size to 128x128, centre, anchored to the bottom by increasing Y offset to maximum
* "Layer to Image Size" on the first frame/bottom later
* export to Resized (Ctrl+e) as animation, loop forever, unspecified frame disposal set to "replace", 100 milliseconds


### open in gifsplitter

* tick Autofill directory
* tick single background color
* set background color to pure green (#00ff00 / R:0, G:255, B:0) 
* Split Now
* copy the folder "_output" into the gif's split-up folder (or create an empty folder called "_output")
* open the split-up folder
* right click "_output" and open propeties
* copy the Location string

### open cmd (WITH IMAGEMAGICK INSTALLED)

* type "cd "
* right click "Paste" (has to be a right click)
* press enter
* copy, paste, and run the following line: `mogrify -alpha Set -format png *.bmp`
* copy, paste, and run the following line: `FOR %G IN ("*.png") DO convert "%G" -transparent #00ff00 "_output\%G"`
* rename "_output" to the Pokédex number


Folder of Frames is now finished. Drag this folder into your Unity Assets Resources folder with the others to add it to the game
