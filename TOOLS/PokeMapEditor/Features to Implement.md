# Features to Implement

## v1.0

- [x] improve lighting
- [x] set grid to perfect 1x1

## v1.1

- [x] add Z-Alignment

## v1.2

- [x] stabilise cursor position 
	(added x-ray to sensor, hitting only object with property: "this")
- [x] prevent stretch rotation of objects on different Z to cursor
	(rotates around object's z position instead of cursor's)

## v1.3

- [x] allow holding add/remove to "paint"
	(changed Mouse1 ==1 to ==2, to check while held instead of when pressed)
- [x] remember last direction
	(added a variable to own[] to remember the previous object's angle)

- [x] add export model feature
	(uses each placed object's vertices and polygons to recreate an .obj file)

## v1.5

- [x] add support for exporting rotated tiles
	(adjusts the vertex local position using the objects z orientation)
- [x] decrease opacity of cursor

## v1.6

- [x] add camera controls
	(uses keypad, 5 to re-center)
- [x] angle camera to assist perspective-editing
- [x] increase maximum map size
	(75x75)

## v1.7

- [x] make new files export to a different name
	(generates a random number upon loading the program, using that as the name)

## v1.8 (unfinished)

- [ ] auto-import models from a models-folder
- [ ] allow orthographic/perspective view switching
- [ ] create standalone executable
